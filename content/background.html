<h3> Gender </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Women make up 21% of respondents and students in the class, which is less than the percent of women in tech (<a href="https://builtin.com/women-tech/women-in-tech-workplace-statistics">25%</a>).
  </span>
  The class saw a 3% increase in women representation from 1A to 4B, in first year, 
  18% of the class were women.
  <br /> <br />
  There are many on-campus communities that supports the success of women in
  computer science and engineering at UWaterloo. For example,
  <a href="https://sesoc.uwaterloo.ca/wise">Women in Software (WiSE)</a>,
  <a href="http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/">Women in Computer Science (WiCS)</a>,
  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-engineering/">Women in Engineering (WiE)</a>, and

<h2> International Students, Immigration and Home Location </h2>
<h3> International Students </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  8.4% of respondents are international students, however, according to the official headcount
  12.9% of the students in the class are international students.
  </span>
  The class saw a 2.1% decrease in international students from 1A (15%) to 4B.
  This could be due to the higher tuition costs for international students, especially in Engineering.
  International term tuition fees, prior to the academic year 2018/19 where it was subject to a 62.1% fee increase, 
  were around $15000 for computer science students. This made the computer science program more cost beneficial to
  international students.
  <br /> <br />
  International students came from countries such as China and India.
