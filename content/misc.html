<h3> Burnout </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    We made it through Waterloo Engineering but not without some hurdles along the way.
  </span>
  On average, respondents felt burnout in 3.34 of 8 academic terms (~42%).
  The median and mode were both 2.
  <br /> <br /> <!-- Newline -->
  The results are heavily skewed towards the lower levels, meaning that
  most respondents found the academic aspect of SE manageable.

<h3> Physical Conflict </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    No one was involved in a physical fight outside of a martial arts setting
    during their degree.
  </span>
  This question was asked to get some signal on conflicts that SE students may have
  been involed in. All 49 respondents said they had never fought outside a sport
  setting.

<h3> Reddit Usage </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    The University of Waterloo had the world's most populated university subreddit
    until recently.
  </span>
  Needless to say, we're big redditors. Here is a breakdown of how many hours were
  spent by respondents on the platform.

<h3> Beauty in the details </h3>
<p class="full">
Reflecting on our time at Waterloo means more than making some graphs. Here are
some stories over the past 5 years.

      "In my second coop term, I snuck into Google's headquarters in Palo Alto with 
      my good friend [redacted] on a weekend, and no one was around so we stole their
      campus bikes and went sightseeing around the area. My phone's camera had broken
      autofocus so we couldn't get nice pictures, which is the sad part. We were good
      boys so we returned the bikes. Finally, in an attempt to catch the free Palo Alto shuttle, we ran for a good
      few kilometres.
      
      <br /><br />
      
      [This] stands out as one of my favourite days in SE since it was the
      day I learned about [redacted]'s interest in entrepreneurship, which also made
      me more optimistic about it, which has now led into us building out our FYDP
      venture."

      "The closest friends I made, I made them in the Software Lounge. I don't know
      if its the room or the people who also thought the lounge was a great place to
      hangout, but I had so many fond memories there. I worked there all the time
      and sometimes cried there too, played a lot of games, goofed around, slept on
      the couch (which is definitely a must) but also that's where I got to meet my
      FYDP team. Find a Software Lounge in your life and oh my your University Degree
      is gonna fly by."

      "I got drunk at a work party on time in San Francisco on a work term. I don't
      remember anything that happened that night but I woke up in a hospital with
      vomit on my jeans, and was told I was found on the side of some street.
      <br /><br />
      Hospital and ambulance bills ended up costing me over $6000 USD, and my
      travel insurance didn't cover it because it was a 'self-inflicted injury'.
      Thankfully I had work insurance and only ended up paying $2000. I went in
      to work the next day.

<h3> Crying Frequency </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Coping with all that life throws at you at these very developmental years is
    a difficult task.
  </span>
  Everyone expresses themselves differently and crying is a natural, common,
  but unfortunately minimized method.
  <br /><br />
  Of those who responded, Waterloo SE students cried once a term on mode and median,
  1.7 times on average.
  <br /><br />
  It is difficult to determine how these results map onto the total SE student population.
  A non-answer could imply a (low or high) extremity.

<h3> Contemplating Enrollment </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    The majority of SE students considered switching to another major.
  </span>
  This relates to the age old question asked of Waterloo students:
  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/future-undergraduate-students/comparing-bse-basc-comp-eng">
    What's the difference between Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and
    Software Engineering?

<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Most SE students had no doubts about completing their bachelors.
  </span>
  Only 4 respondents pondered leaving university.

    Results from the previous two graphs came from mostly SE grads.
  </span>
  44 of the 50 respondents are SE graduates of this year. This represents about half
  of the total graduates (92). <!-- TODO: confirm that it was 92 grads? -->
