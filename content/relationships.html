<h2>Family</h2>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    A good chunk of us spend time with our family, either digitally
    (88.7 %) or in person (71.67 %).
  </span>
  Before the pandemic, most of us lived near campus and away from family.
  <br /><br />
  The average amount of time spent digitally in a month with parents
  was 5.10 hours.

  Before the pandemic, 85 % of us lived more than 50 kilometres away from our
  families. The furthest someone lived away was 20 000 kilometres away. That
  would explain why 63 % of respondents spent on average less than a day with
  their parents in person.

<h2>Friendships</h2>
<div class="long_version">
<p class="full">
  On average, a softie made 4.36 new friends over co-op, and 3.05 over a school term.
  They would lose on average 1.30 friends over co-op, compared to 0.55 over a school
  term. Thus, the net gain in friends over co-op is about 3.1 friends, while the net
  gain over a school term is 2.31 friends.

    From classmates to friends..?
  </span>
  We asked SEs to recall what the most touching thing a fellow classmate
  had done for them. The following responses are either directly quoted or
  rephrased from the original submissions.
</p>
<div class="hvb"></div>
<h3>The most touching thing that a classmate has done for me was...</h3>
<p class="quote">
  Sticking by my side since day 1.
  <br /><br />
  Pulling an all nighter to help me with an assignment they had already finished.
  <br /><br />
  Reaching out during COVID. The number of people (myself included now!) who've
  just touched base to have little catchup calls, who I probably wouldn't have
  talked to too much in person, has been really sweet.
  <br /><br />
  To help me travel home on St Patrick's day when I was blackout drunk.
  <br /><br />
  Supporting me when I needed help in a foreign country.
  <br /><br />
  To give me notes.
  <br /><br />
  When one classmate introduced me to his friends and made me feel super welcome
  when I transferred into SE. It was super awesome of him to do so and those
  [friends] were the friends I stuck with throughout SE.
  <br /><br />
  Hosting a surprise party for my birthday.
  <br /><br />
  Staying up with me after a breakup
  <br /><br />
  One time my classmate bought us a PS5 so we could play Call of Duty in between
  assignments.
  <br /><br />
  So many, I can't even think of what was the "most" touching.

<h2>Romance</h2>

  <span class="big">
    About 33.9 % spent at least half of their degree in a romantic relationship.

  spent at least half of their degree in a romantic relationship. Only 1 person was
  not single throughout their entire degree.

    "How has your understanding of relationships changed
    in the past 5 years?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    The people who we cared most about in our lives who we
    have parted ways with are not gone. They exist as memories,
    as voices of our consciences, and as layers of the characters
    we are today.
    <br></br>
    Understanding compromise.
    <br></br>
    Yes.
    <br></br>
    They take time to nurture and maintain. That's not
    meant to sound overly pessimistic, but if you have a
    busy schedule, you need to think consciously about the
    relationships you want to keep and those you don't to
    have a happy social life.
    <br></br>
    The USD, which bases on the American economy, is more
    stable than most relationships.
    <br></br>
    People are like plants: some need more water, others
    less, and watering them is your responsibility. Maybe
    this plant needs more than you can give, maybe that
    one you like less; ultimately you decide who you want
    to keep in your life and water that relationship.
    <br></br>
    I've learned more to love in my own way, instead of
    mimicking the relationship of my parents. 
    <br></br>
    Oh so completely different with my parents and family.
    Treated completely like an adult and I swear I've been
    helping parent my little brother.
