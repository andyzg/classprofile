<h1 id="coop"> Co-op </h1>
<h3> Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    At least 150 companies have hired an SE student.
  </span>
  Students had the opportunity to work in many different types of environments,
  including working at a 5 person startup, writing code in Shanghai,
  researching with professors, and working at a big tech company.
  While a majority of students were software engineers during their co-ops,
  some explored other areas such as game development, product management, security and trading.
  <br /> <br />
  The benefit of having 6 co-op terms is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps students figure out what they want
  upon graduation.

<h3> Locations </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    77% of respondents co-oped in at least 2 different countries.
  </span>
  The majority that co-oped in the US worked in California.
  One of the reasons for this is because of the Silicon Valley which is the headquarters for many
  large tech companies that hire software engineers such as Google, Facebook,
  Apple, etc.
  <br /><br />
  Every odd co-op term, there was at least one student working outside
  of North America. This included locations in Europe and Shanghai.
  <br /><br />
  Although the University of Waterloo did not authorize any co-ops outside of Canada once the pandemic hit, 35.4% of respondents
  said they worked in the US for their last co-op. One explanation is that in order
  to graduate from Software Engineering only 5 (now 4 as a result of the pandemic) out of 6 approved co-ops need to be completed, so students
  may not have cared about the restrictions. Another reason is respondents may have decided to provide the location of the office they would have
  worked for if it wasn't for the pandemic.

<h3> Favourite Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  68% of respondents' favourite work location was in the US and 39.6% was specifically in California.
  </span>
  While California is still preferred by most, this suggests that it is not
  for everyone. The infamous ‘Cali or Bust’ mentality and the pandemic could have hindered
  some students from exploring opportunities in other cities that may have
  been better suited for them as well. 
  <br /><br />
  This also shows that Canada's brain drain is real and Canadian cities
  are failing to attract and / or retain Canada's top talent.

<h3> Salary </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Median hourly compensation increased over time until the pandemic hit. By the last co-op term, 
  compensation had on average tripled in comparison to the first co-op term.
  </span>
  Average hourly compensation per co-op term were <b>$21.48, $32.07, $32.18, $55.35, $57.47, $60.36</b> (in CAD).
  <br /><br />
  The difference could be explained by the exchange rate between the USD and the CAD, as more respondents 
  started working in the US, and an increase in salaries and
  stipends to compensate for the difference in living costs between different
  locations. For example, San Francisco housing typically costs between
  $1,500 to $2,500 per month. In comparison, Waterloo housing costs approximately $700 per month. 
  <br /><br />
  The lower median hourly compensation may be lower in the last co-op because respondents were not able to work in 
  the US or worked for US companies on a Canadian payroll and received lower compensation as a result.
  <br /><br />
  Note that some of these values include other types of compensation such as stipend and others may not.

<h3> Co-op Applications Breakdown</h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
  As respondents gained work experience, they applied to less jobs over time
  and found more jobs outside of WaterlooWorks.
  </span>
  Respondents applied to 3 times less jobs by their last co-ops. The number of interviews
  respondents had every term varied between 3.62 and 8.20, and the number of offers received
  every term varied between 1.6 to 2.84.
  <br /><br />
  Around 30% of respondents found their job externally. In particular, 60% of respondents found their
  job externally on their last co-op term. There could be several reasons for this increase: the first one
  is that students were interested in jobs not listed on Waterlooworks, another reason could be the pandemic which
  encouraged students to apply on more than one job board.

  <br /><br />
  Note: The average number of external applications is only based on respondents who looked
  for external jobs.

    15 mins late to my 30 min interview and burst into the room. The interviewer was surprisingly very kind and

<h3> Favourite Co-op Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    With 5-6 co-op experiences under their belt, we wanted to see what companies were among students' favourites and why.
  </span>
  Among 31 respondents, we grouped the written responses among the 8 categories below to see which factors weighed most when choosing their favourite companies.
  <br/>
  Interest in work was the most common factor affecting students' enjoyment at a company. When students are engaged and interested in their work and projects, they get more enjoyment from their co-op experience.
  Following that, factors such as salary, work benefits, culture, and co-worokers were roughly equally important factors.

<h3> Favourite Co-op Experiences </h3>

<h2> Does X affect job pay? </h2>
<h3> Salary as a metric </h3>
<p class="full">

In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a proxy metric to
measure job opportunities. Due to the subjectiveness of this metric, the following
results should be taken with a grain of salt because higher salary does not
imply higher job satisfaction.
</p>

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  There is no clear correlation between grades and salary.
  </span>
  In other words, having a high cumulative average does not imply that the student
  will get a good salary in the upcoming co-op term. This suggests that there
  are more important factors than grades when it comes to finding a good job.
  <br /><br />
  Some companies do use grades as a cutoff to filter large amounts of candidates.
  However, many companies are aware that grades are not a good indication of how
  performant a student can be during co-op.
  <br /><br />
  This suggests that if a student wanted to optimize for getting the best co-op
  possible, aiming for a higher grade may not yield the desired results, and
  their efforts can be redirected towards other involvements such as side
  projects.

<h3> Gender </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Women are paid less than men on average for co-op terms.
  </span>

  Although the data trends from our survey indicate that women are paid less than men,
  it is difficult to determine which portion of the compensation difference is due solely
  to gender bias, as opposed to other causes. The other variables include a difference in
  interests (in terms of work location, type of work, etc.) among men and women
  respondents in the class.
  <br/>
  Note: There were about 30-42 men and 8-9 women who responded to co-op salaries.
  <br /><br />

  However, this does not suggest that there is no gender bias in the long term.
  In fact, according to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://research-content.glassdoor.com/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf">a
    Glassdoor study</a>,
  "younger workers face a smaller gender pay gap than older workers." This
  finding is not exclusive to the tech industry.

<h3> Hackathons </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Respondents who attended at least one hackathon earned 33.6% more on average than those that
    didn't attend any.
  </span>

  In other words, students who show passion for building projects get better job
  opportunities than those that don't. Alternatively, this result could be
  because students that attended a hackathon cared more about getting a higher
  paying job.
  <br /> <br />

  Respondents who attended more than 5 hackathons did not earn more than those who only attended at least 1.

<h3> Side projects </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Respondents that build side projects earned 8.8% more on average than those that
    didn't build side projects.
  </span>
  The more time that a student invests into side projects, the more they are likely
  to get paid. Side projects are often seen as the closest thing to software
  work experience, making it a great time investment to compensate for any lack
  of work experience.

  <br /> <br />
  It is important to mention that <b>side projects and hackathons are not the only way to find
  a job</b>. There have been many less practiced methods students have used to
  find job opportunities such as referrals, networking, etc.
  <br /> <br />
  It is just as important to note that <b>students who are not involved in software-related
  extracurriculars still find great jobs</b>. In fact,
  many SE students and faculty encourage pursuing interests besides software.
