        Had there been more information about going on exchange,
        namely to address graduation concerns and course flexibility,
        and an easier application process, more softies would have gone
        on exchange.
    </span>
    The exchange program was briefly introduced to us in our
    second year, during an optional seminar. It's then no wonder
    that, of the 54 responses received for the exchange section,
    85 % did not go on exchange.

        Of the 46 who said they had not gone on exchange, 16 said that they
        would have gone had:
    </p>
    <p>
        - there been more exposure to the exchange program;
    </p>
    <p>
        - the exchange application process been easier;

        - global events such as Covid and the Hong Kong unrest not been a thing.

<h2>SE Abroad</h2>
<p class="full">
    <span class="big">
        When asked whether they would suggest going on exchange to future SEs, 7
        out of 8 said yes.
    </span>
    SE students who have gone on exchange usually went on a study term after their
    2A term. A good amount went on exchange in their 3B term. All but one respondent
    recommended that future SEs attempt going on exchange. All respondents went abroad
    for only a single term. The sister universities SEs attended were all in Europe
    (UK, Netherlands, Switzerland) or Asia (Singapore, South Korea).

<h3> The Exchange Experience </h3>

    <span class="big">
        "An invaluable opportunity to travel and to immerse yourself in a different
        culture."
    </span>
    We asked our exchangees to provide us some insight into their exchange experience.

<h5>What was the hardest thing about going on exchange?</h5>
<p class="quote">
    The paperwork and the course planning.
    <br /><br />
    The language barrier - the area is mostly French-speaking.
    <br /><br />
    Finding a co-op for the next term, especially if the term start/end dates did
    not match the typical UW start/end dates.
    <br /><br />
    Connecting with the locals and making friends in a meaningful capacity. Some
    exchange schools have a more mature program than others where it is easier to
    make friends. If I were to do exchange again I would opt for a school where a
    lot of international students go and where the program is well established.
    <br /><br />
    Balancing schoolwork/wanting to graduate at the same time as the SE cohort with
    taking advantage of being in a new country. Oh, and the timezone differences when
    communicating with friends, family, group project members and North American
    interviewers was a pain.

<h5>What about something that was easier to do for/while on exchange?</h5>
<p class="quote">
    Applying for exchange.
    <br /><br />
    Less time spent on school, more time available for travelling.
    <br /><br />
    Having fun was easier.
    <br /><br />
    Studies at my exchange program were significantly easier than at UWaterloo.

<h5>What are your thoughts on your exchange experience as a whole?</h5>
<p class="quote">
    Exchange is an invaluable opportunity to immerse yourself in culture and
    travel abroad.
    <br /><br />
    It's a great opportunity to travel around and experience a different culture.
    <br /><br />
    Exchange was by far my favourite term while at UW. I would highly recommend it.
    <br /><br />
    It was hard to find the next [co-op]; everything else is fantastic!
    <br /><br />
    Exchange was an invaluable experience for me. I was left to my own devices in an
    alien country with a different culture and had to learn to live like a local. I
    learned various aspects of the local culture which I have sought to incorporate
    into my own life. I also got the chance to travel to many countries in Europe
    where I met a ton of new people and had many great experiences.
    <br />
    I think the biggest benefit of exchange is to be removed from the regular groove
    of familiarity and being placed in a completely different landscape which forge
    new connections and patterns of thinking. It can also be a ton of fun!
    <br /><br />
    Definitely go on exchange if you have the chance/want to, but do your research
    in earlier years so that you can plan for an exchange term accordingly. It's nice
    to discover other cultures and to live in a different country for an extended
    period of time. Another plus is to be able to take some courses not offered at
    UWaterloo (NLP anyone?).
