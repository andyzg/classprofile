<h3> Post-graduation plans </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    90% of respondents had already accepted a job offer two months prior
    to graduating.
  </span>
  However, only 52 of the 92 SE graduates, and a few who transferred,
  answered this question. The only take-away is that most students had
  the opportunity to accept a job offer prior to graduating.
  <br></br>
  Respondents pursuing further education will be doing so at Columbia University,
  Stanford University, as well as back at the University of Waterloo.

    Big tech and trading firms hired many of the SE grads.
  </span>
  Unfortunately, only 51 students answered this question,
  so just over 55% of the total graduating class. It is likely
  that the full breadth of companies and industries is larger
  when considering everyone's future.

    The co-op experience acts as a great pipeline for hiring
    young talent for companies.
  </span>
  It also enables students to find a workplace they enjoy, as shown by the
  sheer amount of students opting to return to a co-op employer rather
  than accepting an offer elsewhere.

    Students do not feel the need to become accredited as Professional Engineers.
  </span>
  Most students have no intention to pursue a license with the PEO. This is
  required to have your job title include the term "Engineer" within Canada.
  Very few industries restrict hiring to accredited engineers and instead employ
  "software developers".

  are interested in or that they believe will be beneficial to pursue
  further.

  SE students being satisfied with their situations.

<h3> Full-Time Compensation </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    The compensation for the first year of full-time work for respondents
    will average $284,728 CAD, with a median of $260,000. This number
    includes all forms of remuneration eg. signing bonuses and equity.
  </span>
  The exchange rate used for this question and the ones that follow was 1.3
  CAD per 1 USD. That rate was accurate at the time the survey was shared,
  but the rate is 1.2 as of writing.
  <br /><br />
  Since 77% of respondents will be relocating to the US, we can estimate
  the new average and median earnings to actually be $267,882 and $244,600 CAD.
  <!-- 260k*(1 + 0.77(1.2/1.3 - 1)). -->

    The hourly wage / salary will have a median and an average of $81 and

  We can again estimate this to be $76 and $99 CAD with today's exchange rate.

    There's a huge discrepency in profit sharing for new grads,
    with the median and average being $32,500 and $95,392 CAD.
  </span>
  "Profit sharing" here is used to encompass stock options, RSUs,
  and other forms of equity-based compensation.
  <br /><br />
  There are extreme outliers that skewed the mean and median greatly.
  <br /><br />
  With the new rate, the results are $30,505 and $89,742 CAD.

    Sign-on bonuses were common for respondents, with the median and

  </span>
  The mode response was $0 for a signing bonus with 15 responses out of
  the total 47.
  <br /><br />
  Adjusting for the new exchange rate, we find the median and average to be $37,630 and $59,248 CAD.

<h3> Motivations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    An enjoyable workplace and a good compensation were the biggest factors in
    accepting full-time roles. 
  </span>
  It is great to see the class value a positive environment above compensation.
  <br /><br />
  In contrast to most other industries, software recruitment has remained
  relatively unaffected in the face of a global pandemic. Only 1 respondent factored
  job security in their decision-making.

<h3> Moving home </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    27% of respondents plan to return to their home country after having moved away.
  </span>
  Moving away is a big change. There's a fairly even split among students who would like to return home or stay abroad, while the rest of students haven't decided yet.
  This goes to show that everyone has different goals and each student should find what's important to them.
  <br/><br/>
  One common tip from alumni is to pursue what makes you happy and aligns with your values.
  This way, you can find the most happiness in what you do, whether that's close to home or abroad.

<h3> Closing Remarks </h3>
<p class="full">
  The following is a summary of the advice shared by students with the
  intention of being shared with both prospective and current SE students.
  Many of the sentences
  are directly quoted or rephrased from the original advice.

    If you want to be super organized when packing and moving
    around, store photos of various layers of your packed bags.
    Then, when you need to go on a similar trip (whether it's
    2 weeks in a tropical location or moving to a new city for
    co-op), you know exactly what to pack and where, and it
    basically requires no time at all to get ready!
    <br></br>
    Take the same courses as the people you live with.
    <br></br>
    If you don't collect air miles you're missing out on

    Surround yourself with successful people who will naturally

    "What is one piece of advice you would give to your
    first-year self?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    Have confidence. You deserve to be here.
    <br></br>
    Overworking yourself never works! You reach a point
    w[h]ere putting more work doesn't yield the cost benefit
    necessary, instead you will feel much better and
    perform as well or better by being involved in something
    you enjoy.
    <br></br>
    Don't take everything so seriously. Take the time to
    learn even if it means lower marks, and take some time
    to explore projects, hobbies and have fun!
    <br></br>
    I don't think my first-year self would have taken my
    advice.
    <br></br>
    Spend more time having fun. Always keep well being and
    quality of life in mind.
    <br></br>
    Don't limit your co-op applications to one place - especially
    in first year. It's better to apply to a variety of jobs
    in a variety of locations -- use that as an excuse to
    lightly travel when on [co-op].
    <br></br>
    Stop sending cringey snaps when drunk.
    <br></br>
    Buy doge coin.
    <br></br>
    People are less intimidating than you think.
    <br></br>
    Take more risks throughout university.
    <br></br>
    Be yourself.

    "What was the best lesson you learned in your undergrad?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    Compassion.
    <br></br>
    How important reflection time is. Taking time to reflect
    on how I'm feeling about all parts of my life has led to
    some of the biggest, most positive changes I made during
    undergrad.

    How to learn complex ideas quickly.
    <br></br>
    Figure out what you want and don't be afraid to go
    against the norm. Don't strive for something just
    because other people do.
    <br></br>
    Stress baking helps a lot, surprisingly.
    <br></br>
    The importance of being confident in yourself and what you can do.
    <br></br>
    Cramming last minute works fantastically, unless it doesn't.
    <br></br>
    Mental health is as important as physical health. In tandem,
    your productivity doesn't define your self worth. It's fine
    to have a day where you don't get anything significant done.
    <br></br>
    Humility.
