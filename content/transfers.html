<h3> The Switch Years </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
    The majority of the respondents switched out of the program in their second or third year.
</span>
The data here was a combination of both the survey and the SE board results. We see that a majority of students switched programs
in their second or their third year. It is also interesting to note that almost always a plurality of transferring students left SE in
an Excellent academic standing.

<h3> Reason for Switching </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
    A flexible course schedule is the main reason for switching out of Software Engineering.
</span>
The Engineering program has a relatively rigid course schedule which offers students the flexibility to choose courses usually only in their fourth year. 
The Computer Science program, on the other hand, is less restrictive and allows students to customize their schedules freely. 
<br /> <br />
Other reasons for transferring included avoiding a course, graduating early, and accommodating for an exchange term.

<h3> Disliked Courses </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
    ECE 105 and ECE 106 were the disliked courses among transferred students.
</span>
All the disliked courses of transfered students were part of the course requirements for SE. As seen earlier, students likely transferred
in order to have a more flexible schedule for future terms and to take courses better suited for them.

<h3>I Regret Nothing</h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
    None of the transferred students surveyed regretted their decision.
</span>
The Computer Science program was successfully able to provide the transferred students with a better place to align themselves with their university goals.
