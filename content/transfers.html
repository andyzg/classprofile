<h3> Reason for Switching </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
    Flexible Course Schedule is the main reason for switching out of Software Engineering
</span>
The engineering program has a relatively rigid course schedule which offers students with the flexibility to choose courses in Fourth year. 
The computer science program on the other hand is less restrictive and allows students to customize their schedules freely. 
<br /> <br />
Other reasons for transferring included avoiding a course, graduating early and accommodating for an exchange term.
