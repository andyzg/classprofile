<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Starting in 1B, class average gradually increased over time.
  </span>
  We can also notice that B terms tend to yield a slighly lower average, this is
  likely the results of hard courses being taken on a B term, such as ECE 106, ECE 124,
  SE 380, etc.
  <br /><br />
  4A and 4B term average appear to be significantly higher among respondents. This can be
  due to several reasons; starting in 4th year SE students are able to pick 3-4 electives per term, 
  it may as well be the result of the transition to an online delivery for courses or because only 19
  respondents disclosed their 4B term average.
  <br /><br />
  Note that this data may not be necessarily representative of the class. The official median
  for each term is as follows:

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Attendance consistently drops term by term, except after 3B.
</span>
  This could be because respondents enjoyed their 4A & 4B classes more as they get
  to select almost all of their classes, or possibly because respondents
  preferred attending courses asynchronously.

<h3>Failures</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  34% of respondents failed at least one midterm and 14.5% of respondents failed at least one course.
  </span>
  Failing a midterm does not necessarily mean that the course will be failed as well.

<h3>Options</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  2 respondents completed an option.
  </span>
  Graduating with an Option can be complicated to do in Engineering. With a restrictive amount of elective slots,
  most students will need to either overload a term (or multiple terms), or complete courses over co-op in order to meet
  all the requirements for the Option and for graduating in SE.

<h3>Transferred From</h3>

  <span class="big">
  Some students joined the class later into their degree. All respondents who transferred into the
  class came from within Engineering.
  </span>
  Computer Science students do not appear to be interested in transferring into the class. Some possible explanations is
  the freedom provided by the CS program and the possibility of taking a Digital Hardware or a Software Engineering specialization.

  The most favourited professor with 14% of the votes is Martin Pei.
  </span>
  For this section, respondents were only able to select one professor among all the
  professors they had during their academic career.
  <br /><br />
  Some professors listed in this section did not teach a core course, which means
  not every respondent had the opportunity to be taught with said professors.

  are the most popular core courses.
  <!-- Although 3B was the most difficult term, it had Concurrency (CS343), the most popular course. -->
</span>
  The top favourited courses were all taken between 2B and 3B, this can either be because
  respondents don't remember much of their first 3 terms' courses, or that respondents
  enjoyed more higher level courses.

<h3> Least favourite required courses </h3>

    and <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se380" target="_blank">SE 380 (Introduction to Feedback Control)</a> were the most disliked core courses.
  </span>
  Some Linkage Electives were also not liked among the class such as SMF 101, SPCOMM 100, and SPCOMM 223.
  <br></br>
  It's important to note that courses that were disliked do not imply that
  respondents find the content useless. Instead, a variety of factors, such as
  personal interests, final grades, and workload, may have come into play.
  For example, Operating Systems (SE 350) is considered useful by 96% of students
  <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se350" target="_blank">
    according to UWFlow</a>, despite being nominated as a least favourite course.

<h2> Overloading </h2>
<h3>Overloading & Academic Terms</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Overloading is popular among the class with 28 respondents (53%) overloading
  at some point during their academic degree.
  </span>
  The 3A and 4A terms are the most popular ones to overload. The SE curriculum encourages
  students to overload in their 4A term to have a lighter term in 4B, which can be busy
  with graduation traditions and FYDP work on top of courses.

<h3>Overloading Reasons</h3>

  When COVID hit, most respondents still decided to move back to Waterloo in their 4A term.

<h3> Enriched Programs </h3>

  On average, respondents who took part in an Enriched Program performed worse in first year than respondents who
  did not take part in an Enriched Program. To be clear, this does not suggest that doing an Enriched Program is not
  beneficial to students, instead, it suggests that Enriched Program do not give an evident advantage in comparison
