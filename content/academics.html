<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Starting in 1B, class average gradually increased over time.
  </span>
  We can also notice that B terms tend to yield a slighly lower average, this is
  likely the results of hard courses being taken on a B term, such as ECE 106, ECE 124,
  SE 380, etc.
  <br /><br />
  4A and 4B term average appear to be significantly higher among respondents. This can be
  due to several reasons; starting in 4th year SE students are able to pick 3-4 elective per term, 
  it may as well be the result of the transition to an online delivery for courses or because only 19
  respondents disclosed their average in their 4B term.
  <!-- Note that 4B we don't have lots of data points,
  That Median are not really representative
  1A: 86.4
  1B: 81.3
  2A: 84.8
  2B: 82.2
  3A: 87.8
  3B: 83.1
  4A: 89.6
  4B: 90.6

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Attendance consistently drops term by term, except after 3B
</span>
  This could be because students enjoyed their 4A & 4B classes more, or maybe students
  enjoyed attending courses asynchronously.

<h3>Options</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  2 respondents completed an option.
  </span>
  Graduating with an Option can be complicated to do in Engineering. With a restrictive amount of electives,
  most students require to either overload a term or terms, or complete courses over coop in order to meet
  all the requirements for the Option and for graduating in SE.

  For this section, students were only able to select one professor among all the
  professors they had during their academic career.

  Some professors listed in this section did not teach a core course, which means
  not every student had the opportunity to be taught with said professors.

<h2> Courses </h2>
<h3> Favourite courses </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Among core courses, <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/math239" target="_blank">MATH 239 (Introduction to Combinatorics)</a>
  and <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/cs349" target="_blank">CS 349 (User Interface)</a> were the most popular courses. Among electives 
  <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece454" target="_blank">ECE 454 (Distributed Computing)</a>
  was the most popular.
  <!-- Although 3B was the most difficult term, it had Concurrency (CS343), the most popular course. -->
</span>
  The top favourited courses were all taken between 3A and 4B, this can either be because
  students don't remember much of their first and second year courses, or that students
  enjoyed more higher level courses.
  <!-- Students are also required to take several technical electives to fulfill
  their credits.  The most popular electives included Graphics (CS488),
  Distributed Computing (ECE 454), and Human-Computer Interaction (CS 449). -->

  Most of the disliked courses were core courses, although some of them were also Linkage Electives (SMF 101, SPCOMM 100, SPCOMM 223)
  <!-- Although SE 463 is just as disfavoured, it was a much easier course, which explains why 4A
  was an easier term. -->
  <!-- It's important to note that courses that were disliked do not imply that
  students find the content useless. Instead, there are a variety of factors
  such as personal interests, final grades, and assignments. For example, Logic and
  Computation (SE 212) is considered useful by 88% of students

<h2> Overloading </h2>
<h3>Overloading & Academic Terms</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  28 respondents overloaded at some point during their academic degree.
  </span>
  The 4A and 3A terms are the most popular term to overload. The SE curriculum encourages
  students to overload in their 4A term to have a lighter term in 4B, which can be busy
  with graduation traditions and FYDP work on top of courses.

<h3>Overloading Reasons</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  The most popular reasons to overload were to have a lighter term and to
