<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Study terms gradually become more difficult, but class averages remain
    consistent.
  </span>
  3B was voted as the most difficult term by students. Despite being the most
  difficult, its class average was only slightly lower compared to other terms.
  This suggests that students progressively become better at coping with
  difficult courses.
  <!-- Note that 4B we don't have lots of data points,
  That Median are not really representative
  1A: 86.4
  1B: 81.3
  2A: 84.8
  2B: 82.2
  3A: 87.8
  3B: 83.1
  4A: 89.6
  4B: 90.6

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Attendance consistently drops term by term, except after 3B
</span>
  3B also happens to be the hardest term.
  <br /><br />
  This could be because students enjoyed their 4A classes more, or maybe they
  were possibly looking to compensate for their lower grades in 3B.
<br /><br />
  Alternatively, students attend slightly more class more during summer terms
  (2B and 4A).

<h2> Courses </h2>
<h3> Favourite required courses </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Although 3B was the most difficult term, it had Concurrency (CS343), the most popular course.
</span>
  The top 8 favourited courses were all between 2A and 3B. Although
  these terms are slightly more difficult, they also happen to have the most
  interesting content for students.
  <br /><br />
  Students are also required to take several technical electives to fulfill
  their credits.  The most popular electives included Graphics (CS488),
  Distributed Computing (ECE 454), and Human-Computer Interaction (CS 449).

<h3> Least favourite required courses </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    3B also had Feedback Controls (SE 380), the most disliked course, which
    explains why it was the hardest term.
  </span>
  Although SE 463 is just as disfavoured, it was a much easier course, which explains why 4A
  was an easier term.
  <br /><br />
  It's important to note that courses that were disliked do not imply that
  students find the content useless. Instead, there are a variety of factors
  such as personal interests, final grades, and assignments. For example, Logic and
  Computation (SE 212) is considered useful by 88% of students
  <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se212" target="_blank">
    according to UWFlow.</a>

<h2> Does X affect grades?</h2>

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  There was no correlation between self-reported attendance and grades.
</span>
To be clear, this does not suggest that not going to class is
beneficial. Instead, it suggests that it is possible to achieve good grades without
attending all classes.

<h3> Parents' education </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Grades are slightly higher when at least one parent had a university-level degree.
  </span>
  This suggests that there could be a correlation between parents' education and how
  academically inclined students are.
  <br /><br />
  However, this does not suggest that having a parent with a university-level degree is a
  requirement for getting good grades.

<h3>Location</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  The preferred residences in first year was V1 and UWP (not CMH). From first year on, Lester was the most popular
  street to live on in Waterloo.
  <!-- Students come from many different ethnic backgrounds  -->
  <!--, which span 27 different countries. -->
  </span>
  The likely popularity of Lester street is how close it is to Campus. 
  When COVID hit most people decided to stay in Waterloo in their 4A term, likely hoping that measures would loosen over the summer.
  However, in 4B, most students decided to move back home.
  <!-- There was a significant number of students Caucasians, and East
  Asians, although it is interesting to note that most Women were East Asian. -->
